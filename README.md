# Music Popularity Analysis on Spotify and YouTube

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that investigates the relationships between the popularity metrics (views, likes, comments) of music on Spotify and YouTube and various audio features such as danceability, loudness, instrumentalness, acousticness, and speechiness.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to understand how different audio features correlate with the popularity of songs on two major platforms: Spotify and YouTube. By analyzing these relationships, we can gain insights into what makes a song popular and how these features influence listener preferences.

## Introduction

Music streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube provide vast amounts of data that can be analyzed to understand trends and preferences in music. This project focuses on exploring how various audio features impact the popularity of songs.

## Data Collection

The data used in this project was collected from the following sources:
- **Spotify API**: To retrieve audio features and popularity metrics.
- **YouTube API**: To gather view counts, likes, and comments for music videos.

## Data Preprocessing

Before performing the analysis, the data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency. This included:
- Removing duplicates and missing values
- Normalizing data formats
- Merging datasets from Spotify and YouTube

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA process involves examining the data to uncover patterns and relationships. Key steps include:
- Descriptive statistics to summarize data
- Visualization of distributions and correlations
- Identifying outliers and anomalies

## Results

Our analysis revealed several interesting insights:
- **Danceability**: Higher danceability scores tend to correlate with more views and likes on both platforms.
- **Loudness**: Louder songs generally receive more engagement, especially on YouTube.
- **Instrumentalness**: Songs with lower instrumentalness are more popular, suggesting that vocals play a significant role in song popularity.
- **Acousticness**: Acoustic songs have varied popularity, with some highly popular and others less so, indicating a niche audience.
- **Speechiness**: Songs with moderate speechiness levels tend to perform better, possibly due to the balance between music and lyrical content.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates that audio features can significantly impact the popularity of songs. Understanding these relationships can help artists and producers create music that resonates more with listeners.

## Future Work

Future analysis could include:
- Incorporating additional features such as genre and release date
- Analyzing trends over time
- Exploring the impact of different promotional strategies on song popularity
